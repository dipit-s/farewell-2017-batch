            First of all thanks for not kicking me out of Dramanite'19. Pehli baar kisi "Senior" se darr laga tha ü•∂
Gradually during practices and all, getting to know you was truly amazing and I'm only grateful to have you as my senior. From the first event working with you, I learned a lot and most importantly "punctuality". Thanks for believing in me and giving me a second chance. Will miss u a lot Di üíô
Wish u all the best for your future endeavours.

            Hey dii, dramzest mein the play 'saza' you wrote in like one day which was super commendable. It would've been really good (if we could only perform it whole on stage ‡≤•_‡≤• aaj tak bhi woh baat dard deta hai) Anyways dii you be you and I wish you the best in the future!

           Hi Jyotsna dii, You were a splendid senior and a good mentor. I know you are doing well and would also rise & shine in anything you do. I have seen you memorising the script in a stipulated time, saw your intense energy and outstanding performance against the terrific situations. It shows how focused you are in anything you do. Hope to be friends in the future and do stay in touch! And all the very best in all your future endeavours.‚ù§Ô∏è And haan 1 packet sutta ka dabba apne mera khatam kar diya tha SF me. Uska paisa pure K17 ke gift budget se kata hai.üòé<br>
P.s. Do send heart emoticons to Rajjo my friend on a regular basis. He would very much appreciate it. Btw Welcome Rajjoü§£.

            Our relationship has grown so much over the years (much like you, yourself). Still remember the times we were drinking warm water for the 15 August 2017 nukkad. XD
Some might argue it was a bumpy ride at first but I don't mind cause I got to jostle with you. :3
It's been a whirlwind from there to 9:30 new mess and RR breakfast. :-*
Thanks for always being there (even when you didn't know what was it for) and being patient and sensitive enough to let me open up eventually. You're the dash of eccentricity I absolutely need. You know I love you, my teletubby. ;)

I just can't write a farewell message for you it's pretty difficult to be honest. You were just not a senior to be you were more of a friend, a guardian and what not. When I look back in time recalling the first time we met it was 15th August nukkad..  dude your were on fire (bharat mata).. and then I survived dramanite'18 or even for the matter of fact dramanite'19 play only because of you .. I was a stupid first year girl and you were always there looking after me. Thank you for having my back thank you for all the gyans for all the gossips for all the tips  and for all the love , care and support. <br>
I am not gonna write I will miss you because I know your are just a call way and mainly because I know this bond will stay longer than we think.<br>
See you soonest :")<br>
Love you ‚ô°‚ô°<br>

          Hey Jo,<br>

I don't know how you did it but whenever you had an opinion or a discussion it was always on point when it came to Ehsaas. Can't imagine if any of our club events would have had the same level of fun without you. Baaki I hope you are writing a request to change your location from Pune to Gurgaon because I really enjoy meeting you ;) Probably agar lockdown kabhi khatam hua toh we will surely use your ola money to have a breakfast buffet xD Till then have fun you weirdly idiotic and yet so smart girl.

         I never thought I‚Äôd get this much attached to you. Tbh, I didn‚Äôt like you much in my first year because we never really interacted. But when I actually got to know you, I will just say that you are a Sweetheart. One of the most friendly seniors one could have. You are a beautiful and pure person inside out and I mean it. 
Aapne hostel me meri itni help kari hai di.. The day I‚Äôll be back to hostel, I am sure I am gonna miss you the most. I‚Äôll miss Aishanee di ke room me party, watching you guys drunk and dancing with you.. aur aap toh Ranchi aa kar bhi humse nahi mili.. not done :(( <br>
Well Dramsoc me we didn‚Äôt really get many chances to perform together but the Heritage night musical skit was so much fun. And.. I am a huge fan of your nukkad..you have always inspired me.. I wish I had a chance to learn from you.. but never mind. Hope to meet you super soon Jyotu di... <br>
A gentle reminder- Theobroma treat is still due! xDxD<br>
A kind request- Give me some beauty and fashion tips please! ;)) <br>
Loadsss of love. xoxo

       Oh god your tantrums! Par jo bhi hai every performance with you was special... Kyunki practice k time jo bakchodi mei mazza aata tha aapke saath...regardless to say you were a great performer but more than that a great senior/friend. Would always be indebted to you for teaching me two liners I don't know if you remember but aap r puttan bhaiya hi mereko sikhaye the mere SF k audition mei jo mera pehla nukkad performance hua and from there on there was no turning back. There is a lot to say but I am falling short of words. From the regret less breakfast at Capitol hill to going to buy daaru to vajra "pubg wabji bahut khel liya ab khelo paintball" every moment with you was special. Will miss you! Farewell! Special thanks for the nickname Himu xD

         I always underestimated you and your part in any of our work together. I remember you telling me you were gullible before. My reaction to that was as nonchalant as ever.<br>
 And yes, it was me who was a jerk of a person all around and even though I got multiple chances, still couldn't muster up enough courage to apologise in person. Don't know if you'd figure this out but, just wanted to get it all out. Sorry for being a terrible person. Maybe I was the one who was gullible. Still am, because this farewell/apology message is the only thing I could come up with ;_;. See you in sometime maybe.
