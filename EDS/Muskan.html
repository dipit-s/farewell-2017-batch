            I knew you as someone who has a treasure cove for all the gossips around the college....obviously that's not the only side of you. But I never tried looking beyond that to sorry rhega. <br>
Apart from that, mereko lagta hai shayad you are one of the very few people in the whole college who gives a certain positive vibe all the time...i don't know if it's just me but ab jo hai so hai. Nice meeting you Muskaan!

            You are really lovely, just like your name you always have a cute smile. I have told you too many times that you are very cute and sweet. I feel sad that you are going and i didn't got much time to spend with you. But all the time i have talked with you was really great. I don't know why but every time i think about you make me smile and i am sure you are smiling right now too. I really admire you, and wanna be a lifetime friend of yours. If you are interested we can be more than that XP you have my number, we can discuss that. Don't know why but i am pretty sure that i will remain single for a significant amount of time so you have enough time to think. <br>
 Hope you will not forget this little admirer of yours, and keep in touch.

          Hey muskan di, you were a sweet, selfless and a pure hearted person. I think you never scolded me for anything and always took my jokes light heartedly. But whilst you all are going, I feel like stopping you all but sometimes it's just right to let people go because then how will they come back if they hadn't been gone. So I know you will achieve wonders in life and take care of all the people around you and do remember me sometimes. All the best for the future "engagements" . And I'll let you know that I started my journey with you and it's been so sad after knowing that it ended too soon. So hope to perform with you dobara. Lets call it a night. And all the best!!

         Mussu di! I guess everyone else would have written about you being this great performer, cutest most lively person, emitter of positive vibe, lovely to have around being etc,etc to which I also agree completely but jo pata hi hai usko kya repeat karna. Rather when I look back in time recalling moments with you the first thing that comes to mind is my first performance ever....skit dramanite 18 probably.... the type of interaction jo masti majaak wala interaction hua wahan se that continued forever xD regardless of the countless performances we did together which I remember of course but yet are somewhat blurry but what i clearly remember is either me trying to make fun of you or you trying to make fun of yourself xD other way around was not possible so....also though not a big fan of prod house work but saaf safaai wala time was also fun and having you guys around made it bearable. Special mention vajra speech correction I don't know if you remember "crescendo" that day was fun as well.....there is a lot to say but will save it for future....consider this more of a thankyou than a goodbye. Stay blessed favourite. Farewell!
