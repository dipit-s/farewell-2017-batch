           Hey Bongo, You were a very wonderful senior to me. You are too sweet and working with you was so much fun. I couldn't have a better lover( of course in a play üòú) than you. Believe me I learnt so much from you this past year. You are one strong woman and l know you will achive great heights someday. Hope to stay in touch with you in the future. I know you have a big dream ahead of yours. And I wish you all the very best in all your future endeavours. <br>
I wish Someday, we can again visit that stage and build a scene no one ever witnessed. Thank you for all the mentorship!! Bye and all the best.‚ù§Ô∏è

          It actually started with me searching for a good actor for our plays and ended at me getting a really good friend in the end. We had a lot of fun together, wrote a play together and I guys shared almost everything with each other. I really appreciate your work as an actor, writer, director and a youtuber too xD Let's meet soon Bong!
