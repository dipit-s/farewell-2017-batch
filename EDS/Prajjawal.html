           Ab bhaiya kaha se shuru karre apka phela stand up jo maine dekha ya dramanite ya fir moodi, bhoot sari memories hai. Appke sath maine jinte be events kiye college me ,unn sabi events me mujhe sabse jada support appne he kiya. App ke sath Moodi ka pura safer toh hamesha he yaad rahega, khub backchodi ki thi uss duration me. Dramanite me jo ham sab ne mil kar appko uthya tha wo toh ultimate moment thaüòÇüòÇ.
Jinte be college me log dekhe unn me se sabse zada cool aur stud app he the.
App ke sath meri solo photo nahi hai koi par college aane pe wo be tamana puri ho jayegi.
All the best bhaiya for future baki insta aur WhatsApp pe baat hoti he rahegi.

Will really miss activity room ke bahar baarish m beth kar gaane sunna, ya phir aapka mujhe movie suggest karna. Harry Potter discussions to neverending hai. Aapne kabhi kisi cheez ke liye na nahi bola hoga. You are definitely the most humble person I know. I really wish the best for you bhaiya. Will miss you a lot. All the best for future.

Aapke sath 1st year ke first nukkad se lekar aaj tak bahot bakchodi ki hai. Aapke sath yeh 3 saal bahot maza aaya, ab chahe woh Moodi trip me Aapke sath train me naachne me ho, SF me Aapke standup me chilla chilla kr hasne me(bhale hi woh stand up hmlog pehele bahot baar sun chuke the, but phir bhi), Aapke room k shabnami lights me kajra re me naachne me yaa phir kisi practice me Aapke kharab kharab jokes sunne. It was really fun with you bhaiya
And I am gonna miss you a lot‚ù§

           Hey Prajjwal (without an extra A) bhaiya, you are the very first senior with whom I interacted with in the college and also disclosed my crush! xD  From that day till today, I find myself very lucky to meet you. Bahot hi mast and chill senior rahe aap, bina zada strict hue bahot kuch sikha diya..You are that one person jiske pas hum humesha bina kisi second thought ke jaa kar apni problems share kar sakte! Thank you so much for all the love bhaiya!  I won‚Äôt say ‚Äòmiss you‚Äô or ‚ÄòGoodbye‚Äô to you because Bhai ko kya Alvida.. We will always be in touch, Rakhi ka gifts bhejte rehyega !! and video calls karte rahenge! Stickers bhi exchange karenge ;) Your placement treat is still due!

         Fun fact mereko aapke naam ka sahi spelling mei abhi bhi confusion hai but considering ki ye farewell msg ka form dekh k koi kuch bola nhi toh Prajjawal hi sahi hai, prajjwal ya prajawal nhi xD. With that said firstly thank you so much for whatever you have done for the club. Ab aate hai the first day I met you sham mei Vedang aapse milaya aur apparently aap pehle k17 the jisse hm mile, aur bahut log ko nhi pata hoga ye baat ki shayad koi r hota jisse hm pehle baar mil rhe the toh hm shayd itne din nhi hote club mei. Though hm ye pehle bhi bol chuke hai ki you and Kunal bhaiya were the first jiske saath hm perform kiye and immediately I knew if there are people like these here then I ll survive so both of you are special for me. You are just too honest too frank, no politics no senior junior no lauda lasan just pure fun. Regardless to say apna ehsaas k bahar bhi kaafi memories hai all of which will stay preserved for us to reminisce. Delhi trip stands out among those xD Thinking about you brings back uncountable incidents which gradually transforms from us being senior/junior to mentor/mentee to being bhaiya/bhai. There is a lot to say par itna kuch hai words are falling short. Lastly I hope you were a batch mate alag hi level pe hota chiz tab xD Cheers to all our performances together all our achievements all our setbacks. Consider this as more of a thankyou than a goodbye. Special thankyou for being there in you last year as well meant a lot for us as a batch to see a k17 there.Farewell!

        You were one of the few guy who were in touch with me since 1st year. I used to come for the standup comedy gathering where you people talk about shit. You are literally among few to whom i can say anything. You have a few good jokes......no very few good jokes and most of your jokes are either bodyshaming or lame some had very bad timing but some really made me laugh. so, for the sake of those few jokes keep doing standup. <br>
yaar i literally wanted to do standup but everytime i thought of doing that your face come in front of me and he ask "can you be as shameless as me?" i ans NO and then i backed off.<br>
Keep doing standup may be one day you'll become famous and I'll be able to brag about you.
