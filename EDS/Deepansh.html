            You are the first senior I have known since my first day at Ehsaas. I've learned and improved so much with you. You were always there to listen to my ideas, changes in our act, anything and everything. Will truly miss u a lot bhaiya. You have been the best friend, Mentor and guide but most importantly my Food Companion. Idk how would I have survived if u were not there in SF. N when I say survive I mean literally survive. I could never have afford those high priced foods alone for this paapi pet if u were not there to help me, to save me. You were like an angel sent from heaven for us Vegetarians. Will never forget those time I spend with u in SF'21. Thank you for your unconditional love, care, and support. I wish u loads of success and best wishes for your life ahead. Stay in touch bhaiya!

           Hi Deepansh bhaiya. I still remember walking into the auditions for the Hindi play during Dramanite. Sorry that u had to watch that awful audition at the first place 😂😂 But then yall were kind enough to give me the role of Mr Adams. During practice of the play i realised how tough can acting be. But then there were you, to help me out with everything. Introducing to that Danile Day Lewis video... And many other great tips that helped me do that role. I can write a novel on how good a director and writer u are. But more importantly, I just envy ur personality. U r the type of person i would like to replicate in many aspects of my own life. Was looking forward to spend one more year with you, unfortunately that could not happen. But I'm glad that whatever little time i had with u, i hv  managed picking up some crucial values from u, be it in the world of dramatics or real life. Thank you so much for being in Bit mesra ❤️❤️❤️. The campus will miss ur positive presence.

More than a senior you've been a best friend to me. You're genuinely the sweetest and the most caring person I know. Thank you for all the care, love, support and encouragement and also for always being there no matter what. 
May you achieve everything your heart desires and koi farewell nahi aapko kyunki aap ja hi nahi rahe. 
Milte rehna and we'll miss you a lot. All the best for future.

            Your development from 1st year to final year is nothing short of a shonen training arc lmfaoo. From the deluded, naive chutiya to the thoda mature, clearheaded chutiya, I guess you grew up. Baaki kya AOT supremacy. Milo jaldi

            Cute bhaiya🤭
We have made loads of memories during our practice sessions. From explaining the character to making jokes on our dialogue deliveries during practice sessions😂😆🤣.
You remember those pages you wrote when you were high and next day when you brought those pages with you in confidence k... koi meri gandi handwriting ni samajh skta... And then I started reading it out loud😂😆🤣(sahi time pe paper le liya nahi toh saare secrets bahar aa jaane the uss din😈)
You're a great writer bhaiya. And I'm gonna miss the plays written by you🥺
I wish you all the luck for your future❤️
PS- Remember when you taught me the meaning of "bhainga" 🤣😆😂.

Shayad first time hum aapse Riddhi Vivaha ke wajah se mile the.. and the first thing I realised was that you were also Sam bhaiya's kid. 
After that we bonded on different occasions and topics in one year.. 
Keep on sharing content bhaiya XD

BT kam lena aage se and I hope you get time and space to explore more..  keep in touch 
Will miss you :')

           Hey man, I don't think you got the appreciation that you really deserved in this club. All I know that everybody had something to say when it came to play but a very few had the guts to actually write and direct one. Probably the toughest job that you can get to do in this club and I guess you were the only one in our batch we all looked upto. I really appreciate all your thoughts and writings. Very few can actually work under so much pressure and I guess you did work after a lot RR obv xD

            It’s the toughest job to write a ‘farewell’ message for you. You know how much you mean to me right? I still remember the day jab suddenly you asked me “meri behen banogi Sana” and we got very emotional. Aap bahot hi zada sweet ho bhaiya. My go-to person in dramsoc!<br>
It’s strange how we never interacted in my first year aur fir XLRI play se humari jo mast bonding ho gayi.. We have had so much fun together. From bakchodi and gossiping in MoodI to deep conversations in SF.. Inspite of losing in all these fests, I feel so grateful and lucky to be a part of the Play team because it gave me my best friends of college. <br>
I’ll miss you a lot se bhi zada. Milte rehyega bhaiya.. Many more trips to plan. Many more bakchodi to do.. Love you..Raju Tara pe gossip chalte rahega.. and yes, thoda nasha karna kam karye -_- aur khana khaaye!!

           Itna depression me mat jiya karo, man. Baaki smart, sexy to ho hi aap. Raja babu banna choriye aur fuckboi baniye. Zindagi aapke liye taufa laiyegi tab. Aur PV se dur rahiye. Vo insaan ka sabse bada haath hai aapko bigadne me. Baaki aish kariye bangalore me aur kabhi kabhi yaad bhi kar lena. Aur ese hi apne sexy hairstyle se girls ko woo karte rehna. Baaki kya hi bole. Jao bhai jao. Kitna rahat mil raha h jaane se, I can't even explain man. Bas fir alvidaa aur all the best!!
